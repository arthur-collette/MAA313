### Generation of Delaunay Triangulations

Generating Delaunay triangles using two different methods : The first algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer approach. It runs in O(Nlog N) time, which is asymptotically optimal. The second algorithm is iterative and requires O(N^2) time in the worst case. However, its average case performance is comparable to that of the first algorithm.

### Application

We chose to work on an application to terrain generation. We will see a technique for generating terrain by using delaunay triangulation.
